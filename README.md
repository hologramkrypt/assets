## icons

> you can download icons at [gnomelook](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse/).  
> folders should be placed in ***usr/share/icons*** or ***~/.local/share/icons/***

I recommend the [Tela icon theme](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Tela-icon-theme), however this is purely up to your taste and style. I use ***Tela-black***, as it fits well with my theme choices.

if you want, you can download the full pack of icons using snap...

```
sudo snap install tela-icons
```

## cursors

> you can download cursors at [gnomelook](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse/).  
> cursor files can be placed in the same place as icons, ***usr/share/icons*** or ***~/.local/share/icons/***

I recommend something simple and easy on the eyes for your cursor choice.  
I like [Win10OS-Cursors](https://github.com/yeyushengfan258/Win10OS-cursors).  
you can download it from the github linked above, then place it in your ***.icons*** directory.

## themes

> themes can be found at [gnomelook](https://www.gnome-look.org/browse/).  
> you can put these in ***~/.themes***.

I use Kripton-v40.

## wallpapers

> I have a large collection of wallpapers available for anyone to download. Simply clone the directory and put the .wallpapers folder into your home directory, or merge with your own.

```
git clone https://github.com/hologramkrypt/assets.git
```

i do recommend following the structure of having wallpapers in a hidden folder within the home directory. it should be located in ***~/.wallpapers***. this keeps manipulating the folders and adding/removing your own wallpapers a simple. also i hate having my wallpapers in my ***~/Pictures*** directory.

## applications

| Application | Purpose |
| ----------- | ------- |
| [Kvantum](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum/tree/master/Kvantum)     |  Qt config tool     |
| [qt6ct](https://github.com/trialuser02/qt6ct)       |  Qt config tool     |
| [nwg-look](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-look)    |  GTK3 Theming tool   |

These are the utilities I use in order to apply my icons, themes, etc.
